summary: Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a
  lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's
  one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy
  field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.

## You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!

Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. As you wish. I call it luck. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.

The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. You don't believe in the Force, do you? I find your lack of faith disturbing. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.

### I find your lack of faith disturbing.

But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. What!? What?! I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.

No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possiblyâ€¦ You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! I find your lack of faith disturbing. Red Five standing by. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.

As you wish. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! I find your lack of faith disturbing. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? I call it luck.

Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
