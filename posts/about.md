The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.

I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.
